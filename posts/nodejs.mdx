This post is a simple example of how pagination can be implemented in an **NodeJS Express server** using **TypeScript** and it demonstrates the use of middleware functions to handle pagination logic, and how the locals property can be used to store and pass data between middleware functions and route handlers.

Let's implement multi root Pagination using Typescript and Nodejs express server.

- server : NodeJS / express
- client : Rest Client
- database : internal values, Json placeholder, Json server

This code sets up a simple Express server using TypeScript. It creates an instance of the App class, which sets up an Express application and uses the json middleware to parse incoming JSON requests.

```typescript
import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";

class App {
  public application: express.Express;

  constructor() {
    this.application = express();
    this.application.use(express.json());
  }
}

const app = new App().application;
```

It then defines a couple of routes, one for "users" and one for "posts", which are handled by the **paginationResults** middleware. This middleware takes in an array of Model objects as its parameter, extracts the page and limit query parameters from the request, performs some basic validation, and then slices the model array to return a paginated result. The pagination result is then added to the res.locals object and passed to the next middleware.

```typescript
interface Model {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

const users: Model[] = [
  { id: 1, name: "user 1" },
  { id: 2, name: "user 2" },
  { id: 3, name: "user 3" },
  ...
];

const posts: Model[] = [
  { id: 1, name: "post 1" },
  { id: 2, name: "post 2" },
  { id: 3, name: "post 3" },
  ...
];

app.get("/", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.json({ data: "say Hello" });
  res.json();
});

// root 1 : /users
app.get("/users", paginationResults(users), (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.json(res.locals.paginationResult);
});

// root 2 : /posts
app.get("/posts", paginationResults(posts), (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.json(res.locals.paginationResult);
});
```

Then, it defines the route handlers for each route, which simply return the pagination result from the **res.locals** object in the **response**.

## Pagination

You can test this code by running the server in your local environment and making a GET request to either of the routes, passing in the **page** and **limit** query parameters.

Also, it is using the **Request**, **Response** and **NextFunction** types from express module and it is imported using the destructuring import statement import express, `import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";`. This allows you to use these types without having to qualify them with the express namespace.

```typescript
function paginationResults(model: Model[]) {
  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    let page: number = parseInt(req.query.page as string);
    let limit: number = parseInt(req.query.limit as string);

    // validation
    if (isNaN(page) || page < 1) {
      page = 1;
    }
    if (isNaN(limit) || limit < 1) {
      limit = 10;
    }

    const startIndex = (page - 1) * limit;
    const endIndex = page * limit;

    res.locals.paginationResult = {
      result: model.slice(startIndex, endIndex),
      prev: page > 1 ? { page: page - 1, limit } : undefined,
      next: endIndex < model.length ? { page: page + 1, limit } : undefined,
    };
    next();
  };
}

app.listen(3000);
```

## Express's locals property

the code also uses **Express's locals property** to store the pagination results. **locals** is a property on the response object that can be used to store data that is specific to the current request-response cycle. In this code, **the pagination results are stored in res.locals.paginationResult so that they can be easily accessed in the route handlers.**

In the route handlers, the `res.json(res.locals.paginationResult)` is used to send the pagination result as a JSON object in the response.

## validation

It is also worth noting that the paginationResults function uses the parseInt function to convert the page and limit query parameters from strings to integers. If the parse fails, **NaN** is returned. The isNaN function is used to check if the parsed value is NaN or not. If it is, the function assigns a default value of 1 to page and 10 to limit

Overall, this code is a simple example of how pagination can be implemented in an Express server using TypeScript and it demonstrates the use of middleware functions to handle pagination logic, and how the locals property can be used to store and pass data between middleware functions and route handlers.

Finally, the server is set to listen on port 3000, so it can start receiving incoming requests.

## How to use REST Client

- Server : Node.JS express server
- Client : REST Client `(VS-Code extension)`

1. create \*.rest file and then use GET / PUT method

```typescript
send request click
ex) GET http://localhost:3000/  => server : app.get('/', (req, res) => {});
```

2. Sends the Get Mehthod including page&limit query to the server.

```typescript
[root 1 : /users]
ex) GET http://localhost:3000/users?page=2&limit=3

[root 2 : /posts]
ex) GET http://localhost:3000/posts?page=2&limit=3
```

## object type declaration

Extending an object type: interface uses the extends keyword and type uses the & operator

- interface : extends keyword
- type : & operator

An interface can extend multiple interfaces, creating a combination of all of the interfaces.

```typescript
interface i_next {
  next: {};
}

interface i_prev {
  prev: {};
}

interface i_results extends i_next, i_prev {
  result: {};
}
```
